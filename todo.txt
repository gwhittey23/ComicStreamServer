Priority:


----------------
OS Integration:
    Mac OS :
    Windows:
        make taskbar active so it's shown?
        windows service?
        remove tcl/tk from package
    Linux:
        init script to run as server
------------------
Database:
    Versioning scheme?? (migrate or rebuild with each change?)
		rebuilding should try to preserve user data such as bookmarks, favorites, reading lists, users(?)
        
    Keep schema version in own table
    DB resets should drop tables, not delte whole file
    
    bug: per_page setting slice off child lists...?? (mitigated by ordering
    bug: possible cascade confusion on lots of deletes/adds
    
----------------
General Server:
    more efficient queries (less joins, less selects)
    look into https
        need to provide default key and cert files, but offer option for user-supplied
    multiple users??
      bookmarks, favorites, readinglists
    look into  UPNP support via Coherence (https://github.com/coherence-project/Coherence)
------------------
API:
    Versioning!
    selective fields
    search with OR in field
    favorite
    reading list

Entity API:
    add url_path to entity items
---------------------------      
Web UI:
	if first run, dialog on config page to suggest security
	if no folders set, dialog on main page to go to config
	tags, genres in popup
	scrolling in popup
	details popup: add filesize, last read date
	config: file log level
	consolidate all jquery files, make sure all loads are local
	  
Monitor:
    make removal process more efficient with lots of books
    config setting to not auto-remove when book is missing (possible temporarily missing USB driver, for example)
	watchdog doesn't trigger on file moving out of watched area
	maybe do intermitent commits when scanning files
	OR:  do initial commit of all files without metadata tag scans for (relative) immediate availability
